# Sea battle on C++ and OpenGL

Sea battle game (unfinished)


A project of our own development (at the initial stage). It was not completed due to lack of time and opportunity. We used the accumulated knowledge and experience from lessons from the Internet and from books. 
In this program, you can draw your own and the enemy's battlefields, as well as arrange your ships and shoot at the enemy's ships. It may be completed in the future.
